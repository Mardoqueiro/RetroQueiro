# 🛍️ Rétro Quéiro

Welcome to **Rétro Quéiro**, my very first **e-commerce website** — fully built by me from scratch!

## 🧠 The Idea & Inspiration

The name **"Rétro Quéiro"** is a blend of **“Retro”** (classic, nostalgic, timeless) and **“Quéiro”**, taken from my own name, **Mardoquéiro** — giving it a personal, signature feel.

I’ve always been drawn to the **modern vintage aesthetic** — that fusion of clean, modern layouts with nostalgic color palettes, fonts, and design vibes. I wanted to create a shopping experience that felt warm, familiar, and stylish — something that felt like it had *soul*.

This project was not only a portfolio piece but also a major milestone in my coding journey — from layout structuring to navbar logic, responsive CSS styling, and bringing product pages to life.
